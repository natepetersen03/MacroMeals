# MacroMeals
MacroMeals is an application with a interactive user interface based on a unique dataset containing recipes as well as their associated nutritional information.

The full dataset is in final_dataset.csv, and the process by which I generated the dataset is in the Jupyter notebook.

To pull up the user interface, read the setup_instructions.md file.
